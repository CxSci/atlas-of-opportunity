# Atlas of Opportunity

The Atlas of Opportunity is a geospatial data visualization tool from MIT Connection Science built to improve the accessibility of cutting-edge data science.

MIT Connection Science works to better understand how social interactions and economic behavior impact future outcomes of communities across the world. The Atlas of Opportunity showcases recent research revealing that understanding community movement patterns is crucial for understanding economic growth and mobility. Places with more diverse movement patterns are more likely to have higher near-future economic growth.
